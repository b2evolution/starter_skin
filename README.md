# Starter Skin for b2evolution CMS v6

Fork this repository and rename it when you start a new skin for b2evolution.

We will keep this up to date to have the correct minimal files as well as up to date features for a b2evolution skin package.

## Some tips:

- Create a 720x570 pixels `skinshot.png` file for use within b2evolution to visually identify your skin.
- Add some `skinshot_disp.jpg` images to demo the different "disps" of your skin(change the `_disp` part. See included `skinshot_posts.jpg` for example. 
- You can also add additional images by numbering them, e-g: `skinshot_single_02.jpg`
- When you publish your skin, update this readme.md file (it uses Markdown syntax), remove the instructions and include your skinshots like this:

### Front Page

![disp=front](skinshot_front.jpg)

### Posts Page

![disp=posts](skinshot_posts.jpg)

### Single Post Page

![disp=single](skinshot_single.jpg)
